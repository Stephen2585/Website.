    <h1>Alert Bay</h1>
  <p>  Alert Bay is located on the north end of Vancouver Island near Port Hardy and has been my home family's home for some time now. It's located in the territory of the kwakwaka'wakw people, and home to the Namgis First Nation. The population is around 1200 people and some live on the reserve, and what the locals call "the white end" located to the right as you get off the ferry. The bay is surrounded by the ocean and trails, for the people who like to go for hikes, along the beach or a nice stroll though the town. What I like the most about my home is how everyone knows each other and you can almost start a conversation with anyone on your walks. Most the time people know my parents and can relate to me that way which is fine because I might have learned something I didn't know before. Alert Bay and it's people care about one another, and try to support one another especially in the time we live with covid-19 going around.</p>

  <h3> Alert Bay History</h3>
    <p> Alert Bay is a village on Cormorant Island, in the Regional District of Mount Waddington, British Columbia, Canada. 1,200-1,500 people live within the village. Cormorant Island is an island in Queen Charlotte Strait on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. It has a total land area of about 4 square km and is located south of Malcolm Island and east of Port McNeill.</p>

<div>
  <h3>U'mista Cultural Centre</h3>
    <p>In 1921, the Government of Canada, in an effort to stop the potlatch custom of dance, song, and wealth distribution under Section 116 of the Indian Act, confiscated many items including wooden masks, copper shields, and dance regalia. During the 1970s and 80s, the Kwakwaka'wakw regained their possessions after long negotiations. The returned artifacts are housed in a museum at the U'mista Cultural Centre.</p>
